### The following 5 Visualisation were Generated from Different type of Data sets.


## Exersice 1 :- 
All three visualizations show the same fictitious genomic annotations together with fictitious RNA binding protein data in different ways. Recreate each of the shown versions. 
   - 10_project_data_annotations.csv
   - 10_project_data_signals.csv
     
The 10_project_data_annotations.csv file contains fictitious genomic information as visualized in all bottom panels of the example plots. Each horizontal line represents a transcript. A transcript can contain multiple exons (grey rectangles). Transcripts can be located on the '+' or on the '-' strand of the DNA.

10_project_data_signals.csv contains fictitious signals of four RNA binding proteins (P1, P2, P3, P4).

## Exersice 2 :- 

 Scatter plot and Bar plot from Following file.

  - 10_project_data_scatter.csv contains the data needed to create the shown scatter plot
  - 10_project_data_barplot.csv contains the data needed to create the shown bar plot.

### 2-mer Counts In Sequence Data

The file 10_project_data_dna_sequences.txt consists of DNA sequences. Each line is a single DNA sequence. The figure shows that some k-mers are concentrated (occur more often) in some regions of the sequences. To recreate the figure you need to count the occurrences of a kmer at each position for all sequences.

Example: imagine to search for "xx" and "yy" in following sequences.

TCTAAGGxxyyG
xxCGTGGyyCGT
TTTxxACCGyyG
AGCxxACAACyy
TAxxCAAyyAGT
The counts for "xx" and "yy" would be the following:

[1 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 1 0]
